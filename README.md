#Develop an Expo React Native application featuring a user-friendly tab navigation system with two pages. 
#The first page incorporates a ToDo list where users can add tasks and mark them as completed. 
#The second page presents a settings window equipped with checkboxes, enabling users to choose their
#preferred notification types (SMS, Push, Email), which will be stored and managed using Redux.
